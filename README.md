Sensor Trigger Predictor

Project Overview
The Sensor Trigger Predictor is an application I designed to predict whether a sensor will be triggered based on environmental factors such as location, time of day, weather, and motion detection. My application reads data from a CSV file, generates a frequency table, trains a classifier, and provides a graphical user interface for users to make predictions and add new data.

Frequency Table
The frequency table is generated from the sensorTriggered_data.csv dataset, which contains the following columns: Location, TimeOfDay, Weather, MotionDetected, and SensorIsTriggered. The table summarizes the frequency of Yes and No outcomes for each unique combination of the first four features. Below is the formatted frequency table based on the provided dataset:

         Features                 Labels
F1      F2      F3      F4      Yes     No
Inside  Morning Sunny   High    7       2
Inside  Morning Sunny   Low     7       7
Inside  Morning Rainy   High    3       1
Inside  Morning Rainy   Low     2       7
Inside  Night   Sunny   High    8       11
Inside  Night   Sunny   Low     6       8
Inside  Night   Rainy   High    6       5
Inside  Night   Rainy   Low     11      9
Outside Morning Sunny   High    10      4
Outside Morning Sunny   Low     7       5
Outside Morning Rainy   High    5       1
Outside Morning Rainy   Low     6       5
Outside Night   Sunny   High    10      5
Outside Night   Sunny   Low     8       10
Outside Night   Rainy   High    7       6
Outside Night   Rainy   Low     5       6

This table is generated by the fileProcessor class and displayed in the GUI when the classifier is trained.

Java Classes
The project consists of the following Java classes, each with a specific role:

fileProcessor.java

Description: Handles file input/output operations and generates the frequency table. It reads from and writes to the sensorTriggered_data.csv file, processes the data to create a frequency table using a nested HashMap, and formats the table for display.
Key Methods:
openFile(): Creates or opens the CSV file.
getFileWriter(): Initializes a PrintWriter for appending data.
writeLineToFile(String): Writes a new row to the CSV file.
getFrequencyTable(): Generates a frequency table as a Map.
formatFrequencyTable(Map): Formats the frequency table as a string.


ControlCA2.java

Description: Serves as the entry point of the application. It launches the GUI by creating an instance of SensorPredictorGUI and making it visible.
Key Methods:
main(String[]): Initializes and displays the GUI.


SensorPredictorLogic.java

Description: Contains the core logic for training the classifier, making predictions, and adding new data. It interacts with fileProcessor to manage data and compute predictions based on the frequency table.
Key Methods:
trainClassifier(): Generates the frequency table and returns a formatted string.
makePrediction(String): Predicts whether the sensor is triggered based on input features, returning the prediction, probability, and counts.
addNewData(String): Appends a new row to the CSV file and retrains the classifier.


SensorPredictorGUI.java

Description: Implements the graphical user interface using Java Swing. It provides drop-down boxes for selecting input features, buttons for training the classifier, making predictions, and adding data, and a text area for displaying results.
Key Methods:
trainClassifier(): Calls the logic to train the classifier and display the frequency table.
makePrediction(): Generates a prediction based on user-selected features.
addNewData(): Adds a new data row to the CSV file and updates the classifier.



Functionality Included
The application includes the following functionalities:

Data Reading and Writing: Reads from and appends to sensorTriggered_data.csv using fileProcessor.
Frequency Table Generation: Creates a frequency table summarizing the dataset, displayed in the GUI.
Classifier Training: Trains a simple classifier by generating the frequency table, accessible via the "Train Classifier" button.
Prediction: Allows users to select features (Location, TimeOfDay, Weather, MotionDetected) via drop-down boxes and predict whether the sensor is triggered, along with a probability and count of Yes/No outcomes.
Data Addition: Enables users to add new data rows to the CSV file through the GUI, automatically retraining the classifier.
User-Friendly GUI: Provides an interface with drop-down boxes, buttons, and a text area for interaction and result display.


Potential Improvements with More Time
If additional time were available, the following enhancements could be implemented:

Data Validation: Add input validation in SensorPredictorGUI to ensure users select valid combinations and handle edge cases (e.g., empty or malformed CSV rows).
Data Visualization: Integrate charts (e.g., bar charts showing Yes/No distributions) to visualize the frequency table.
File Error Handling: Enhance error handling in fileProcessor to recover from corrupted CSV files or handle missing headers gracefully.
Feature Expansion: Allow users to add new feature categories (e.g., more weather types) dynamically through the GUI.

I would also try complete the level 4 of this project which was to make my application able to calculate the accuracy of the predictor. This would have involved training my predictor on 150 rows of the data â€“ and testing my data on 50 rows
